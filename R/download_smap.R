#' Download SMAP data
#'
#' This function downloads SMAP data in hdf5 format.
#'
#' @param files_to_download A \code{data.frame} produced by \code{find_smap()}
#' that specifies data files to download.
#' @param directory A local directory path in which to save data, specified as a
#' character string. If left as \code{NULL}, data are stored in a user's cache
#' directory.
#' @return Returns a \code{data.frame} that appends a column called
#' \code{local_dir} to the input data frame, which consists of a character
#' vector specifying the local directory containing the downloaded files.
